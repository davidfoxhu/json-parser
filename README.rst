json_parser for Marmalade
=========================

This module can be used to build json_parser into Marmalade
applications.

Since this library is so small it is distributed as source-only, which means
that prebuilt versions do not exist and each app that uses this package will
compile in its own version.

The source is downloaded and packaged unmodified from

    http://fara.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~jsg/json_parser/
